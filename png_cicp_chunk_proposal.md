# Adding support for HDR imagery to the PNG format
Authors (alphabetical): Chris Blume, Pierre-Anthony Lemieux, Chris Seeger

Status: Draft

## Problem to be solved
The gAMA chunk of the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format (specified in [PNG]) parameterized the transfer function of the image as a power law. As such, it cannot model the Reference PQ or HLG OOTFs specified in [BT2100-1], which are commonly used for HDR images.

An existing W3C group note, [BT2100-in-PNG]  specifies an approach which is limited: it supports signaling of only the ITU BT.2100 PQ EOTF and uses magic values in the iCCP chunk to signal color spaces.

## Basic requirements
* does not break current implementations
* extensible signaling of color space based on H.273
* does not require the presence of iCCP chunk and embedded ICC profiles
* cICP chunk comes before IDAT chunk

## Strawman approach
Define a cICP chunk that contains the 7 bytes necessary to carry the
H.273 color space parameters:

* COLPRIMS, 2 bytes, One of the ColourPrimaries enumerated values specified in Rec. ITU-T H.273 | ISO/IEC 23001-8
* TRANSFC, 2 bytes, One of the TransferCharacteristics enumerated values specified in Rec. ITU-T H.273 | ISO/IEC 23001-8
* VIDFRNG, 1 byte, Value of the VideoFullRangeFlag specified in Rec. ITU-T H.273 | ISO/IEC 23001-8

[ed.: these are inspired from recent JPEG standards that incorporate
H.273 color space parameters]

[ed.: The MATOEFFS parameter is not included because PNG does not support YCbCr]

This specification uses the existing iCCP chunk to unambiguously signal the color system of an image that uses the Reference PQ EOTF specified in [BT2100-1]. It also allows graceful processing by decoders that do not conform to this specification by recommending fallback values for the gAMA chunk, cHRM chunk, and embedded ICC profile.

[H.273](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-H.273/en) specifies a controlled vocabulary for the parameterization of
color space information:
* Color Primaries
* Transfer Function
* Matrix Coefficients (only required if essence is stored as Y’CbCr)

Use [ITU-T Series H Supplement 19](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-H.Sup19-201910-I) “recommendations” to signal the controlled vocabulary for image formats commonly used for baseband linear broadcasts or file-based Video-on-Demand(VOD) services.
* Tables within this document summarize values most commonly used in broadcast for 47 different standards documents including H.273
