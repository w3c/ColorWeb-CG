        The Note is a gap analysis document.
        It identifieds the next steps
        for enabling
        Wide Color Gamut (WCG)
        and
        High Dynamic Range (HDR)
        on the Open Web Platform.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p class="note">
        TODO: Add initial context, describe HDR and WGC
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two main
        systems defined for HDR: HLG, developed by BBC and NHK, and Dolby PQ.
        While improvement in video quality has driven the innovation of HDR,
        support for content on the web more generally, e.g., for static images,
        the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element, and in CSS in general, is still
        needed.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Add a brief description of PQ and HLG approaches, including: use of
        metadata, absolute vs relative brightness, proprietary vs open standard,
        etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The BBC has published a frequently-asked questions document
        [[hdr-hlg-faq]] that gives a high level introduction to HDR, and the
        PQ and HLG solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fredrik Hubinette from Google has written a useful document
        [[hdr-chrome]] that discusses the issues with presenting, and in
        particular compositing, SDR and HDR content. This was presented at
        TPAC 2017. It considers both PQ and HLG. (<a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/11/07-colorweb-minutes.html">minutes
          of the TPAC 2017 meeting</a>)
      </p>

      <p>
        On the web, SDR, and HDR content using both HLG and PQ is expected to
        coexist, potentially within the same page, as authors can include
        arbitrary content in their web pages. An example is a page that contains
        multiple embedded videos, or their poster images. This raises the
        question of how to composite content with different color spaces and
        dynamic range encodings.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>
        Support for HDR and WCG on the web is important to allow color and
        luminance matching between HDR video content and surrounding or
        overlaid graphic and textual content in web pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some specific goals include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ensure support for HDR encoded video as a first class citizen on the
          web, including both HLG and PQ, with appropriate rules defined for
          composition of content.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enable support for HDR static images, texual content, and graphics
          rendered via Canvas or SVG.
        </li>
        <li>
          Promote understanding of HDR graphics issues among the web developer
          community.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are a number of specifications potentially impacted by HDR.
        One of the purposes of this document is to identify all documents that
        are possibly affected, so that we can review them and determine any
        changes needed.

      <h2>Specifying Colors in Web Pages</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>CSS Color Module</h3>
        <p>
          CSS defines several ways of specifying the colors to use in web
          pages, in the CSS Color Module specifications. The current Recommendation is
          Level 3 [[css-color-3]], and its successor, Level 4, is now being
          drafted [[css-color-4]]. The various methods in Level 4 are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>sRGB (Red, Green, Blue), using the <code>rgb()</code> and <code>rgba()</code> functions</li>
          <li>Named colors, from early HTML and X11, e.g., 'aqua', 'black', 'blue', 'fuchsia', etc</li>
          <li>HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness), using the <code>hsl()</code> and <code>hsla()</code> functions</li>
          <li>(*) HWB (Hue, Whiteness, Blackness), using the <code>hwb()</code> function</li>
          <li>(*) Lab and LCH (Lightness, Chroma, Hue), using the <code>lab()</code> and <code>lch()</code> functions</li>
          <li>(*) Profiled, device-dependent colors:
            <ul>
              <li>predefined colorspaces: <code>display-p3</code>, <code>a98-rgb</code> (compatible with Adobe® RGB (1998)), <code>prophoto-rgb</code>, <code>rec-2020</code> </li>
              <li>calibrated colorspaces, using <code>@profile</code> to link to an ICC profile.
              This is not limited to RGB: <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-4/#cal-cmyk">CMYK and wide-gamut print spaces</a> are also covered.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Items marked (*) are new in Level 4. <code>rgb()</code>,
          <code>named colors</code>, <code>HSL</code> and <code>HWB</code>
          all resolve to sRGB. The others are WCG.
          To date, all of these are SDR colorspaces.</p>
        <p>
          Section 12 in [[css-color-4]] is titled "Working Color Space", and
          currently empty. It is intended to cover compositing multiple colorspaces.
          We need to define how should compositing work, if
          there is HLG, PQ, and SDR content present. The [[hdr-chrome]]
          discussion document provides useful input. This will require defining
          where black, media/paper white, and peak whites (full-screen and small-area hilights)
          map in the various spaces.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          TODO: Review the draft CSS Color Module Level 4 [[css-color-4]], to
          determine whether HLG and Dolby PQ have an impact. Are their
          capabilities covered by the new additions (*) in Level 4?
          No, they are not. Rec. 2020 is covered, but only for SDR.
        </p>

        <h3>Canvas API</h3>
        <p>
          The HTML <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element provides web applications
          with a resolution-dependent bitmap canvas, which can be used for
          rendering graphs, game graphics, art, or other visual images on the
          fly. The <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element supports either 2D or
          WebGL rendering.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 2D API [[canvas-2d]] defines primitive operations for drawing
          graphics in to a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element, such as drawing
          lines, shapes, and text.
        </p>
        <p>
          The "Color managing canvas contents" proposal [[canvas-colorspace]]
          attempts to address the following use cases:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Content displayed through a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element
              should be color managed in order to minimize differences in
              appearance across browsers and display devices. Improving color
              fidelity matters a lot for artistic uses (e.g., photo and paint
              apps) and for e-commerce (product presentation).
            </li>
            <li>
              Canvases should be able to take advantage of the full color gamut
              and dynamic range of the display device.
            </li>
            <li>
              Creative apps that do image manipulation generally prefer
              compositing, filtering and interpolation calculations to be
              performed in a linear color space.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h3>HTML color input</h3>
        <p>
          The HTML input element has a color type, <input type="color">
          which allows the user to pick or otherwise indicate a color.
          The picker is constrained to produce what HTML calls a
          <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#simple-colour">'simple color'</a>
          such as '#123456'. This is limited to sRGB, and 8 bits per component precision.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            A simple color consists of three 8-bit numbers in the range 0..255,
            representing the red, green, and blue components of the color respectively,
            in the sRGB color space.

        <h3>Media Capabilities API</h3>
        <p>
          Media Capabilities [[media-capabilities]] is a draft specification
          being developed by the Media Working Group. It intends to provide APIs
          to allow websites to make an optimal decision when picking audiovisual
          media content for the user. The APIs will expose information about the
          decoding and encoding capabilities for a given format but also output
          capabilities to find the best match based on the device's display.
        </p>
        <p>
          The API is a replacement for the existing <code>canPlayType()</code>
          function in HTML [canplaytype], and <code>isTypeSupported()</code> in
          Media Source Extensions [[media-source]].
        </p>
        <p>
          The Introduction document [media-capabilities-intro] gives a good
          explanation of the problem that this API is trying to solve.

        <h3>CSS Media Queries</h3>
        <p>
          Media Queries 4 [[mediaqueries-4]] allow authors to test and query
          values or features of the browser or display device, independent of
          the document being rendered. They are used in the CSS
          <code>@media</code> rule to conditionally apply styles to a document,
          and in various other contexts and languages, such as HTML and
          JavaScript.
          <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-4/#color-gamut">
          Section 6.4</a> describes the <code>color-gamut</code> feature, which
          describes the approximate range of colors that are supported by the
          browser and output device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Media Queries 5 [[mediaqueries-5]]
          also allows authors to test and query
          the ambient light level (<code>dim | normal | washed</code>),
          although the assumption seems to be
          that <code>dim</code> means
          "excessive contrast and brightness would be distracting or uncomfortable"
          rather than
          "standard viewing conditions for HDR content".
          The enumeration is,
          deliberately,
          not tied to specific light levels,
          although ambient light sensors are mentioned.

      <h2>Timed Text</h2>
      <p>Timed Text Markup Language [[TTML2]] has a
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml/#style-attribute-color">tts:color attribute</a>
        whose <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml/#style-value-color">type</a>
        is defined to be a value in sRGB, with 8-bit percomponent precision.
        Titles in TTML are thus SDR.</p>
      <p>However, subtitles are composited onto video content
        and TTML does provide a (non-normative)
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml/#hdr-compositing">Appendix Q
          High Dynamic Range Compositing</a>
          which gives equations for converting the sRGB values into either
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml/#pq-hdr">PQ</a> or
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml/#hlg-hdr">HLG</a>
          for compositing onto HDR video.</p>
      <p>Realizing that sRGB is defined to have a peak luminance
        of 80 cd/m² in theory,
        and a somewhat higher value in practice,
        TTML also provides a
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml/#style-attribute-luminanceGain">tts:luminanceGain</a>
        attribute to boost that value for systems (such as PQ)
        which require an absolute luminance value.

      <h2>Static Image Formats</h2>
      <p>
        A static image format is required to store graphics (both camera-capture
        and artificially generated). Suggested use cases include, but are not
        limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Video catch-up website layout objects e.g., a content provider log
          rendered by a browser UI on a television
        </li>
        <li>
          Images of programme content shown on websites
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Any such graphics format would need to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Store the information with sufficient bit-depth to allow correct
          display of HDR material
        </li>
        <li>
          Allow use of the correct primaries and white point
        </li>
        <li>
          Allow use of the correct transform function
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Knowledge of the image primaries allows correct display of color on all
        displays, including displays which would need to apply a gamut reduction
        to the image.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking Portable Network Graphics (PNG) as an example, it is possible to
        store graphics using 16-bits per channel and it is possible to store the
        primaries and white point. Two methods of storing the transfer function
        exist: the storage of a value for gamma, and the storage of an ICC
        profile. The first method, storage of gamma would allow a backwards
        compatible image to be displayed on non-HDR monitors. The second would
        allow the correct display of this image on an HDR display.
      </p>
      <p>
        ICC Profiles store data which allows the correct mapping of captured
        data to/from an all encompassing color space and from/to the all
        encompassing color space to a display device. Version 4 has only a
        D50 based color space and lookup-table based transforms. Version 5
        allows different color working spaces and an algorithmic calculator
        for the transforms. Version 5 is not well supported.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Timed Text Working Group has published a draft specification
        [[png-hdr-pq]] that extends the PNG format to include an iCCP chunk with
        the name "ITUR_2100_PQ_FULL". The chunk contains a given ICC profile,
        linked from the specification, although this profile is not actually
        used, and only its presence is used to enable external rendering of the
        PQ encoded image by the platform. See
        <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-colorweb/2017May/0001.html">
        this discussion</a> on the Color on the Web CG mailing list.

        Netflix have published a blog post [[netflix-hdr]] that describes their
        approach for static images.
